Recipe:

Jolluf Rice

Prerequisites
* 4 cups uncooked long-grain rice
* 6 cups stock chicken,
* 6 medium-sized fresh plum/Roma tomatoes, chopped, OR a 400-gram tin of tomatoes
* 6 fresh, red poblano peppers (or 4 large red bell peppers), seeds discarded
* 3 medium-sized red onions 
* 1 Scotch bonnet peppers (yellow is my favorite!), to taste
* 1/3 cup oil (vegetable,canola,coconut)
* 3 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 teaspoons curry powder
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 2 dried bay leaves
* 2 teaspoons unsalted butter (optional), divided
* 1 dash Salt, to taste

Procedure
. Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.
. In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about Â¼ cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.
. After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.
. Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.
. When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew**, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!
